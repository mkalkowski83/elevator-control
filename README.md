## ** Elevator Control**

Design and implement a system that controls an elevator in a building with multiple floors. The system should handle the following operations:

- Move the elevator up one floor
- Move the elevator down one floor
- Go to a specific floor
- Show the current floor number

Your implementation should ensure that the elevator cannot move below the ground floor or above the top floor. Also, it should return an error message if someone tries to go to a floor that does not exist.
